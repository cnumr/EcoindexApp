This desktop application lets you perform measurements like on [ecoindex.fr](https://ecoindex.fr) , but also get Google's lighthouse measurements, in a single report, with no limitation on measurements. ðŸŽ‰

## Key information

You can either measure **a series of URLs**, or **entire visit courses**.
This version of ecoindex provides stable and consistent measurements as with [ecoindex.fr](https://ecoindex.fr) or [ecoindex-cli](https://github.com/cnumr/ecoindex_python_fullstack/blob/main/projects/ecoindex_cli/README.md).  
Browser cache management guarantees **realistic** measurements.

With this application, you'll get:

- **Simple measurements**:
    - An HTML Lighthouse report with the ecoindex and its best practices.
- **Course measurements**:
    - Lighthouse reports in HTML or JSON with the ecoindex, its best practices and the generation of the environmental declaration, pre-filled.
    - A configuration file, saved in the measurements folder, will enable you to run the measurements as many times as you like, and thus obtain a trend in the environmental performance of this site/functional unit.
